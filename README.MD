<!-- Project Overview: Dictionary App -->

This project is an English-to-English dictionary that fetches word meanings and pronunciations from an external API.

<!-- Tools & Technologies Used -->

HTML: Created the structure, including a search input, API response section, and navigation.
CSS: Styled the layout with a responsive design, including navigation, search, and accordion components.
JavaScript:
script.js: Handles word search functionality using an external API.
accordion.js: Manages accordion interactions for additional content.

<!-- JavaScript Development Approach -->

1. DOM Manipulation: Used document.getElementById and querySelector to interact with input fields, buttons, and result elements.
2. API Integration: Used fetch() to retrieve word definitions and pronunciation from DictionaryAPI.
3. Error Handling: Displayed an error message when the word is not found.
4. Accordion Functionality: Used classList.toggle() to show or hide sections dynamically.
5. User Feedback: Ensured smooth UI updates, such as hiding results until a word is searched.

This approach ensures efficient API usage, a dynamic UI, and a user-friendly experience. 🚀
